# Online-Examination-System

This Java program implements a Online Examination System where users can register, log in, and take a multiple-choice quiz. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what the program does in simple terms:

Key Components
Questions and Answers:

A list of multiple-choice questions is predefined with their options and correct answers.
The program checks if the user selects the right answer.
Users:

Users can register with a unique username and password.
They can log in if they provide the correct username and password.
Exam:

Once logged in, a user can take the quiz.
The quiz presents one question at a time and checks if the selected answer is correct.
Main Features:

Register: Users can create a new account.
Login: Users can log in using their credentials.
Quiz: Logged-in users can take the quiz.
Exit: The program terminates when the user chooses to exit.
Step-by-Step Execution
Program Startup:

The program starts by setting up a list of questions (initializeQuestions method).
It then repeatedly shows a menu with three choices: Login, Register, or Exit.
Register:

The program asks the user for a username and password.
It checks if the username already exists. If not, it creates a new user and saves it.
Login:

The user enters their username and password.
The program checks if these credentials match any registered user.
If successful, the user is logged in, and the exam starts.
Taking the Quiz:

The logged-in user is shown all the quiz questions one by one.
For each question, the program displays the question text and possible answers.
The user selects their answer, and the program checks if it is correct or not.
Feedback (Correct/Incorrect) is displayed for each question.
Exiting the Program:

The user can choose to exit the system at any time by selecting "Exit" from the menu.
Important Points
Questions:

Each question is an object that contains the text, a list of answer options, and the correct option.
This is implemented using the Question class.
Users:

Users are objects with a username and password. They are stored in a list for validation during login.
Session Management:

A loggedInUser variable keeps track of who is logged in.
A flag sessionOpen ensures the user is in an active session when taking the exam.
Code Structure
Main Method:
Controls the menu and system flow.
Helper Methods:
initializeQuestions: Sets up the quiz questions.
register: Handles new user registration.
login: Authenticates existing users.
